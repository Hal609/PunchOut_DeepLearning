    Sequential decision problem base class

    This class represents a base class for sequential decision problems.

    performing a single step in the problem, and updating the time index.

    Attributes:
        State (namedtuple): Named tuple representing the state variables.
        Decision (namedtuple): Named tuple representing the decision variables.
        state_names (list): List of state variable names.
        decision_names (list): List of decision variable names.
        initial_state (State): Initial state of the problem.
        state (State): Current state of the problem.
        objective (float): Objective value of the problem.
        t (float): Current time index.
        T (float): Terminal time.
        prng (RandomState): Random number generator.
        episode_counter (int): Which set of historical data (episode) to be used.

    Methods:
        __init__: Initializes an instance of the SDPModel class.
        reset: Resets the SDPModel to its initial state.
        build_state: Sets the new state values using the provided information.
        build_decision: Builds a decision object using the provided information.
        exog_info_fn: Abstract method for generating exogenous information.
        transition_fn: Abstract method for computing the state transition.
